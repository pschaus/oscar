  Harriet, upon returning from the mall, is happily describing her four shoe 
  purchases to her friend Aurora. Aurora just loves the four different kinds 
  of shoes that Harriet bought (ecru espadrilles, fuchsia flats, purple pumps, 
  and suede sandals), but Harriet can't recall at which different store (Foot 
  Farm, Heels in a Handcart, The Shoe Palace, or Tootsies) she got each pair. 
  Can you help these two figure out the order in which Harriet bought each 
  pair of shoes, and where she bought each?
  1. Harriet bought fuchsia flats at Heels in a Handcart.
  2. The store she visited just after buying her purple pumps was not Tootsies.
  3. The Foot Farm was Harriet's second stop.
  4. Two stops after leaving The Shoe Place, Harriet bought her suede sandals.
