  Lecture scheduling problem in Oscar.
  Biggs: Discrete Mathematics (2nd ed), page 187.
  """
  Suppose we wish to schedule six one-hour lectures, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6.
  Among the the potential audience there are people who wish to hear both
  - v1 and v2
  - v1 and v4
  - v3 and v5
  - v2 and v6
  - v4 and v5
  - v5 and v6
  - v1 and v6
   *
  How many hours are necessary in order that the lectures can be given
  without clashes?
  """
  Note: This can be seen as a coloring problem.
