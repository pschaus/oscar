 * Puzzle #: 9
 * Stars: 1
 *
 * When the Sunny Hills Country Club golf course isn't in use by club members,
 * of course, it's open to the club's employees. Recently, Jack and three other
 * workers at the golf course got together on their day off to play a round of
 * eighteen holes of golf.
 * Afterward, all four, including Mr. Green, went to the clubhouse to total
 * their scorecards. Each man works at a different job (one is a short-order
 * cook), and each shot a different score in the game. No one scored below
 * 70 or above 85 strokes. From the clues below, can you discover each man's
 * full name, job and golf score?
 *
 * 1. Bill, who is not the maintenance man, plays golf often and had the lowest
 * score of the foursome.
 * 2. Mr. Clubb, who isn't Paul, hit several balls into the woods and scored ten
 * strokes more than the pro-shop clerk.
 * 3. In some order, Frank and the caddy scored four and seven more strokes than
 * Mr. Sands.
 * 4. Mr. Carter thought his score of 78 was one of his better games, even
 *    though Frank's score  was lower.
 * 5. None of the four scored exactly 81 strokes.
 *
 * Determine: First Name - Last Name - Job - Score
