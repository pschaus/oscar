  Appointment scheduling (set approach) in in Oscar.
  From Stack Overflow 
  Appointment scheduling algorithm (N people with N free-busy slots, constraint-satisfaction)
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11143439/appointment-scheduling-algorithm-n-people-with-n-free-busy-slots-constraint-sa
  """
  Problem statement
  We have one employer that wants to interview N people, and therefore makes N 
  interview slots. Every person has a free-busy schedule for those slots. Give an 
  algorithm that schedules the N people into N slots if possible, and return a 
  flag / error / etc if it is impossible. What is the fastest possible runtime complexity?
  My approaches so far
  Naive: there are N! ways to schedule N people. Go through all of them, for each 
  permutation, check if it's feasible. O( n! )
  Backtracking:
  1. Look for any interview time slots that can only have 1 person. Schedule the person, 
     remove them from the list of candidates and remove the slot.
  2. Look for any candidates that can only go into 1 slot. Schedule the person, remove 
     them from the list of candidates and remove the slot.
  3. Repeat 1 & 2 until there are no more combinations like that.
  4. Pick a person, schedule them randomly into one of their available slots. Remember 
     this operation.
  5. Repeat 1, 2, 3 until we have a schedule or there is an unresolvable conflict. If we 
     have a schedule, return it. If there's an unresolvable conflict, backtrack.
  This is O( n! ) worst case, I think - which isn't any better.
  There might be a D.P. solution as well - but I'm not seeing it yet.
  Other thoughts
  The problem can be represented in an NxN matrix, where the rows are "slots", columns 
  are "people", and the values are "1" for free and "0" for busy. Then, we're looking for 
  a row-column-swapped Identity Matrix within this matrix. Steps 1 & 2 are looking for 
  a row or a column with only one "1". (If the rank of the matrix is = N, I that means that 
  there is a solution. But the opposite does not hold) Another way to look at it is to 
  treat the matrix as an unweighed directed graph edge matrix. Then, the nodes each 
  represent 1 candidate and 1 slot. We're then looking for a set of edges so that every 
  node in the graph has one outgoing edge and one incoming edge. Or, with 2x nodes, it would 
  be a bipartite graph.
  Example of a matrix:
     1 1 1 1
     0 1 1 0
     1 0 0 1
     1 0 0 1
