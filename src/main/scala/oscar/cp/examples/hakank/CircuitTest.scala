/*
  Decomposition of circuit constraint in Oscar.
  Here we implement a decomposition of circuit (circuit_me)
  and also a path extraction for the circuit (circuit_path).
  Please note that Oscar has a built-in circuit/1. This
  model is just an etude...
  Comparison (where the results redirects to a file)
  Using my decomposition (circuit_me) took 47.103s
  with these statistics:
    It was 362880 solutions.
    (time(ms),46091)
    (#bkts,362879)
    (time in fix point(ms),15771)
    (time in trail restore(ms),6487)
    (max trail size,2076)
  Using the built-in circuit (circuit) took 44.652
  with these statistics (slightly better):
     It was 362880 solutions.
     (time(ms),43639)
     (#bkts,362879)
     (time in fix point(ms),13336)
     (time in trail restore(ms),5682)
     (max trail size,1181)
  Without any output of the solutions it's much faster (~ factor 2).
  My decomposition (circuit_me) took 25.178s
     It was 362880 solutions.
     (time(ms),24232)
     (#bkts,362879)
     (time in fix point(ms),14445)
     (time in trail restore(ms),6485)
     (max trail size,2076)
  Built-in (circuit) took 22.406s
     It was 362880 solutions.
     (time(ms),21439)
     (#bkts,362879)
     (time in fix point(ms),12849)
     (time in trail restore(ms),5674)
