  Divisible by 9 through 1 problem in Oscar.
  From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/ee957404.aspx
  " Solving Combinatory Problems with LINQ"
  """
  Find a number consisting of 9 digits in which each of the digits 
  from 1 to 9 appears only once. This number must also satisfy these 
  divisibility requirements:
   1. The number should be divisible by 9.
   2. If the rightmost digit is removed, the remaining number should 
      be divisible by 8.
   3. If the rightmost digit of the new number is removed, the remaining 
      number should be divisible by 7.
   4. And so on, until there's only one digit (which will necessarily 
      be divisible by 1).
