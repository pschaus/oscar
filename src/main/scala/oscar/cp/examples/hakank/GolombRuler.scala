  Golomb Golomb ruler in Oscar.
  CSPLib problem 6
  http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob006/index.html
  """
  These problems are said to have many practical applications including 
  sensor placements for x-ray crystallography and radio astronomy. A 
  Golomb ruler may be defined as a set of m integers 
  0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_m such that the m(m-1)/2 differences 
  a_j - a_i, 1 <= i < j <= m are distinct. Such a ruler is said to contain 
  m marks and is of length a_m. The objective is to find optimal (minimum 
  length) or near optimal rulers.
  Note that a symmetry can be removed by adding the constraint that 
  a_2 - a_1 < a_m - a_{m-1}, the first difference is less than the last.
