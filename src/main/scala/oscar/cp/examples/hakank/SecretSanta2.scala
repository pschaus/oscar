/*
  Secret Santa problem II in Oscar.
  From Maple Primes: 'Secret Santa Graph Theory'
  http://www.mapleprimes.com/blog/jpmay/secretsantagraphtheory
  """
  Every year my extended family does a 'secret santa' gift exchange.
  Each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for
  them. At first, none of my siblings were married, and so the draw was
  completely random. Then, as people got married, we added the restriction
  that spouses should not draw each others names. This restriction meant
  that we moved from using slips of paper on a hat to using a simple
  computer program to choose names. Then people began to complain when
  they would get the same person two years in a row, so the program was
  modified to keep some history and avoid giving anyone a name in their
  recent history. This year, not everyone was participating, and so after
  removing names, and limiting the number of exclusions to four per person,
  I had data something like this:
  Name: Spouse, Recent Picks
  Noah: Ava. Ella, Evan, Ryan, John
  Ava: Noah, Evan, Mia, John, Ryan
  Ryan: Mia, Ella, Ava, Lily, Evan
  Mia: Ryan, Ava, Ella, Lily, Evan
  Ella: John, Lily, Evan, Mia, Ava
  John: Ella, Noah, Lily, Ryan, Ava
  Lily: Evan, John, Mia, Ava, Ella
  Evan: Lily, Mia, John, Ryan, Noah
  """
  Note: I interpret this as the following three constraints:
  1) One cannot be a Secret Santa of one's spouse
  2) One cannot be a Secret Santa for somebody two years in a row
  3) Optimization: maximize the time since the last time
  This model also handle single persons, something the original
  problem don't mention.
