  Traffic lights problem (CSPLib #16) in Oscar.
  CSPLib problem 16
  http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob016/index.html
  """
  Specification:
  Consider a four way traffic junction with eight traffic lights. Four of the traffic
  lights are for the vehicles and can be represented by the variables V1 to V4 with domains
  {r,ry,g,y} (for red, red-yellow, green and yellow). The other four traffic lights are
  for the pedestrians and can be represented by the variables P1 to P4 with domains {r,g}.
  The constraints on these variables can be modelled by quaternary constraints on
  (Vi, Pi, Vj, Pj ) for 1<=i<=4, j=(1+i)mod 4 which allow just the tuples
  {(r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r)}.
  It would be interesting to consider other types of junction (e.g. five roads
  intersecting) as well as modelling the evolution over time of the traffic light sequence.
  ...
  Results
  Only 2^2 out of the 2^12 possible assignments are solutions.
  (V1,P1,V2,P2,V3,P3,V4,P4) =
  {(r,r,g,g,r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r,ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r,g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r,y,r,ry,r)}
  [(1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3), ( 2,1,4,1, 2,1,4,1), (3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1), (4,1, 2,1,4,1, 2,1)}
  The problem has relative few constraints, but each is very
  tight. Local propagation appears to be rather ineffective on this
  problem.
